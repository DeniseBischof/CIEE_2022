## UI
### What is an UI?

## How to create a UI in Unity:
**Right click** into your **Hierarchy** and choose a new **UI element**. (For Textmeshpro objects, you have to import the TMP package, Unity will ask you automatically.)

A Canvas will automatically be created, to incorporate your new UI object. 
The Canvas is **the basic component of Unity UI**. It generates meshes that represent the UI Elements placed on it, regenerates the meshes when UI Elements change, and issues draw calls to the GPU so that the UI is actually displayed.

In order to create a GameOver Screen, you can either simply create a picture beforehand in another software and import it into Unity, or you can build one yourself with the UI components.

To build one yourself, right click into your hierarchy and create an **Image**. Fill the Canvas with the whole Image (change the image size by pressing T or R) and set it to a color of your liking. Afterwards add a **Text** with Game Over to your Canvas. 

Childobjects will always be rendered over Parentobjects and objects who are lower in the Canvas Hierarchy will also be rendered on top of the others.

At the end, add a **Button** with Continue to your Canvas.
(Please note, that if you put a transparent picture over your Button, it might not be clickable. Turn off Raycast Target, in order to avoid this.)

Buttons in Unity can easily call a method from another object. Simply drag and drop the object you wish to call a script from into the On Click() component. Choose the method you want to call in there and thats it. (The method has to be public to be called from outside)

### Changing a text via script:
In order to change a text component you have to add a new library at the top of your script:

	using System.Collections;
	using System.Collections.Generic;
	using UnityEngine;
	using UnityEngine.UI;

	public class HighscoreCounter : MonoBehaviour
	{
	    [SerializeField] private Text text;
	    private int currentHighscore = 0;

	 public void setHighscore()
	    {
		currentHighscore += 10;

		text.text = currentHighscore.ToString();
	    }
	}

To change a number to a string you can call this method:

    iAmANumber.ToString();

### Reloading your Scene:
In order to reload a scene via script you have to add a new library at the top of your script:

    using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

Then you can simply create a new method and use this to reload the scene:

    public string loadScene;
    
    public void loadNewScene()
    {
    	SceneManager.LoadScene(loadScene);
    }

### Adding Music:

I order to play some music in your Scene, create a new Empty Gameobject and give it a name like "BackgroundAudio". Add an AudioSource component to it.

You can find descriptions to all the [properties here.](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-AudioSource.html)


### Call Audio from Script:

     AudioSource m_MyAudioSource;
    
    void Start()
    {
    	m_MyAudioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();
    }
    
    public void PlaySound()
    {
    	m_MyAudioSource.Play();
    }
    		
    public void StopSound()
    {
    	m_MyAudioSource.Stop();
    }

### Please note, that an Audiosource can only play 1 sound at a time. If you need more, you have to create multiple AudioSources.
