## UI
### What is an UI?

## How to create a UI in Unity:
**Right click** into your **Hierarchy** and choose a new **UI element**. (For Textmeshpro objects, you have to import the TMP package, Unity will ask you automatically.)

![How to Create a UI in Unity 3D - Studica Education and Technology Blog](https://i0.wp.com/blog.studica.com/storage/2016/04/UI-2.png?resize=327%2C559)

A Canvas will automatically be created, to incorporate your new UI object. 
The Canvas is **the basic component of Unity UI**. It generates meshes that represent the UI Elements placed on it, regenerates the meshes when UI Elements change, and issues draw calls to the GPU so that the UI is actually displayed.

In order to create a GameOver Screen, you can either simply create a picture beforehand in another software and import it into Unity, or you can build one yourself with the UI components.

To build one yourself, right click into your hierarchy and create an **Image**. Fill the Canvas with the whole Image (change the image size by pressing T or R) and set it to a color of your liking. Afterwards add a **Text** with Game Over to your Canvas. 

Childobjects will always be rendered over Parentobjects and objects who are lower in the Canvas Hierarchy will also be rendered on top of the others.

At the end, add a **Button** with Continue to your Canvas.
(Please note, that if you put a transparent picture over your Button, it might not be clickable. Turn off Raycast Target, in order to avoid this.)

Buttons in Unity can easily call a method from another object. Simply drag and drop the object you wish to call a script from into the On Click() component. Choose the method you want to call in there and thats it. (The method has to be public to be called from outside)

### Reloading your Scene:
In order to reload a scene via script you have to add a new library at the top of your script:

    using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

Then you can simply create a new method and use this to reload the scene:

    public string loadScene;
    
    public void loadNewScene(){
    	SceneManager.LoadScene(loadScene);
    }

### Adding Music:

I order to play some music in your Scene, create a new Empty Gameobject and give it a name like "BackgroundAudio". Add an AudioSource component to it.
![](https://docs.unity3d.com/uploads/Main/AudioSourceInspector.png)
 
   **Audio Clip**  
   A container for audio data in Unity. 
   
   **Output** 
   By default, the clip is output directly to the [Audio Listener](class-AudioListener.html) in the Scene. 
   
   **Mute** 
   If enabled the sound will be playing but muted.
   
   **Bypass Effects** 
   This is to quickly “by-pass” filter effects applied to the audio source. An easy way to turn all effects on/off.
   
   **Bypass Listener Effects** 
   This is to quickly turn all Listener effects on/off.
   
   **Bypass Reverb Zones** 
   This is to quickly turn all Reverb Zones on/off.
   
   **Play On Awake** 
   Set this to true to make an Audio Source start playing on awake [More info](class-AudioClip.html)  
   
   If enabled, the sound will start playing the moment the scene
   launches. If disabled, you need to start it using the **Play()**
   command from scripting.
   
   **Loop** 
   Enable this to make the **Audio Clip** loop when it reaches the end.
   
   **Priority** Determines the priority of this audio source among all the ones that coexist in the scene. (Priority: 0 = most important.
   256 = least important. Default = 128.). Use 0 for music tracks to
   avoid it getting occasionally swapped out.
   
   **Volume** 
   How loud the sound is at a distance of one world unit (one meter) from the **Audio Listener**A component that acts like a
   microphone, receiving sound from Audio Sources in the scene and
   outputting to the computer speakers. [More
   info](class-AudioListener.html)   See in
   [Glossary](Glossary.html#AudioListener).
   
   **Pitch** 
   Amount of change in pitch due to slowdown/speed up of the **Audio Clip**. Value 1 is normal playback speed.
   
   **Stereo Pan** 
   Sets the position in the stereo field of 2D sounds.
   
   **Spatial Blend** 
   Sets how much the 3D engine has an effect on the audio source.
   
   **Reverb Zone Mix** 
   Sets the amount of the output signal that gets routed to the reverb zones. The amount is linear in the (0 - 1)
   range, but allows for a 10 dB amplification in the (1 - 1.1) range
   which can be useful to achieve the effect of near-field and distant
   sounds.
   
   **3D Sound Settings** 
   Settings that are applied proportionally to the Spatial Blend parameter.
   
   **Doppler Level** 
   Determines how much doppler effect will be applied to this audio source (if is set to 0, then no effect is applied).
   
   **Spread** 
   Sets the spread angle to 3D stereo or multichannel sound in speaker space.
   
   **Min Distance** 
   Within the MinDistance, the sound will stay at loudest possible. Outside MinDistance it will begin to attenuate.
   Increase the MinDistance of a sound to make it ‘louder’ in a 3d
   world, and decrease it to make it ‘quieter’ in a 3d world.
   
   **Max Distance** 
   The distance where the sound stops attenuating at. Beyond this point it will stay at the volume it would be at
   MaxDistance units from the listener and will not attenuate any more.
   
   **Rolloff Mode** 
   How fast the sound fades. The higher the value, the closer the Listener has to be before hearing the sound. (This is
   determined by a Graph).
   
**Logarithmic Rolloff**
   The sound is loud when you are close to the audio source, but when
   you get away from the object it decreases significantly fast.
   
   **Linear Rolloff**
   The further away from the audio source you go, the less you can hear
   it.
   
   **Custom Rolloff** 
   The sound from the audio source behaves accordingly to how you set the graph of roll offs.


### Call Audio from Script:

     AudioSource m_MyAudioSource;
    
    void Start()
    {
    	    m_MyAudioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();
    }
    
    public void PlaySound()
    {
    		m_MyAudioSource.Play();
    }
    		
    public void StopSound()
    {
    		m_MyAudioSource.Stop();
    }

### Please note, that an Audiosource can only play 1 sound at a time. If you need more, you have to create multiple AudioSources.
